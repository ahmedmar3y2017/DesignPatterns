When to use the Observer Design Pattern?
Below is when to use observer design pattern:

When you need one object to notify multiple others about changes.
When you want to keep objects loosely connected, so they don’t rely on each other’s details.
When you want observers to automatically respond to changes in the subject’s state.
When you want to easily add or remove observers without changing the main subject.
When you’re dealing with event systems that require various components to react without direct connections.
