✅ Final Answer:

Spring AOP is an implementation that uses proxy objects to achieve the same goal as the Decorator Pattern —
dynamically adding behavior around existing objects, without changing their code.



Java I/O Streams (Classic Example)
Logging and Monitoring in Services
✅ Real-world usage: Spring Boot, Microservices, REST APIs
Security and Authentication Layers
HTTP Middleware / Servlet Filters
Data Transformation Pipelines
Caching and Performance Layers

Spring Framework Itself
✅ Real-world usage:
AOP Proxies (as discussed earlier)

BeanPostProcessors decorating beans at runtime

@Transactional, @Cacheable, @Async — all built on proxy/decorator ideas
