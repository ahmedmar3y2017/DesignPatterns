A facade is used to allow the user to perform complex processes with simple actions.


When to use Facade Method Design Pattern
A Facade provide a simple default view of the subsystem that is good enough for most clients.
There are many dependencies between clients and the implementation classes of an abstraction.
A Facade to decouple the subsystem from clients and other subsystems, thereby promoting subsystem independence
 and portability.
Facade define an entry point to each subsystem level. If subsystem are dependent, then you can simplify
the dependencies between them by making them communicate with each other through their facades.
