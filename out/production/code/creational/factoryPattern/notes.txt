Use Cases of the Factory Method Design Pattern
Below are the use cases of factory method:

JDBC uses factories to create connections and statements. Frameworks like Spring and Guice utilize factories for managing beans.
Swing and JavaFX uses factories to produce UI components such as buttons and text fields, offering flexibility in design.
Tools like Log4j and Logback employ factories to create loggers with various configurations, allowing for control over logging levels.
Serialization frameworks use factories to generate objects from serialized data, accommodating different formats and versions.


------------- Advantages of Factory Method Design Pattern
Below are the main advantages of factory method:

Separates object creation from client code, enhancing flexibility and maintainability since changes to creation donâ€™t affect clients.
New product types can be easily added without altering client code by simply creating new Concrete Creator subclasses.
Simplifies unit testing by allowing mock product creation, enabling tests of various implementations without actual object dependencies.
The factory method can be reused across different application parts, centralizing and streamlining object creation logic.
Hides specific product classes from clients, reducing dependencies and improving maintainability.


-------------- Disadvantages of Factory Method Design Pattern
Below are the main advantages of factory method:

Adds more classes and interfaces, which can complicate understanding and maintenance, especially for newcomers.
Polymorphism and dynamic binding may slightly affect performance, though this is usually minimal.
Concrete creators remain closely linked to their products, necessitating changes across both when one is modified.
Client code must be aware of concrete subclasses to make accurate factory calls.
The pattern should be applied carefully to avoid unnecessary complexity; simple object creation may not need a factory.
Testing the factory logic can be more complicated compared to simpler designs.
